## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Supports 4 basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- 🔁 Allows continuous calculations using the previous result
- 🖼 Displays a custom ASCII art logo at the start (via `art.py`)
- 🧠 Uses function-based structure for clean and reusable code
- 🔁 Option to start a new calculation or continue with the last result

## 📦 How It Works

1. The user inputs the **first number**
2. Chooses an operation: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
3. Inputs the **next number**
4. The calculator performs the operation and displays the result
5. The user can:
   - Type `y` to continue using the current result
   - Type `n` to start a fresh calculation
